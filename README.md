Material UI Kit is an open source design system based on the Material Design created by Google. One of the main goals that guided us during its creation was a full reflection of the components contained in the Material UI library, used by web developers. Thanks to this projection, a designer using this UI kit can not only design an application in accordance with Material Design standards faster, but also be sure that developers will be able to quickly transform created mockups into a fully functional application.
